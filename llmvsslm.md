## When to Use SLMs (Small Language Models)

**Edge Deployment & Resource Constraints**
- Mobile devices, IoT, embedded systems
- Limited RAM, CPU, or storage
- Offline functionality required

**Latency-Critical Applications**
- Real-time autocomplete (under 100ms response)
- Interactive UI elements
- Voice assistants needing instant feedback

**Cost-Sensitive Scenarios**
- High-volume simple queries
- Tight budget constraints
- Consumer-scale applications

**Privacy & Security Requirements**
- Sensitive data (healthcare, finance, legal)
- Data cannot leave device/local network
- Strict compliance requirements

**Specific, Narrow Tasks**
- Text classification and sentiment analysis
- Entity extraction, keyword detection
- Domain-specific chatbots
- Autocorrect and grammar checking

**Energy Efficiency**
- Battery-powered devices
- Sustainability concerns
- Green computing initiatives

## When to Use LLMs (Large Language Models)

**Complex Reasoning**
- Multi-step problem solving
- Nuanced context understanding
- Handling ambiguity and edge cases

**Broad General Knowledge**
- Diverse domain expertise required
- Cross-domain connections
- General question answering

**Creative Generation**
- Content writing and storytelling
- Code generation
- Creative problem solving

**Emergent Capabilities**
- Planning and strategy
- Analogical reasoning
- Zero-shot/few-shot learning

**Advanced Understanding**
- Subtle context interpretation
- Complex instruction following
- Abstract thinking
