- Interactive UI elements
- Voice assistants needing instant feedback

**Cost-Sensitive Scenarios**
- High-volume simple queries
- Tight budget constraints
- Consumer-scale applications

**Privacy & Security Requirements**
- Sensitive data (healthcare, finance, legal)
- Data cannot leave device/local network
- Strict compliance requirements

**Specific, Narrow Tasks**
- Text classification and sentiment analysis
- Entity extraction, keyword detection
- Domain-specific chatbots
- Autocorrect and grammar checking

**Energy Efficiency**

## Key Takeaway

**SLMs Excel At:** Focused, repetitive tasks with clear constraints where efficiency, cost, and deployment flexibility outweigh the need for broad capabilities

**LLMs Excel At:** Complex, open-ended tasks requiring reasoning, creativity, and broad knowledge where capability matters more than resource efficiency



SLMs are like a specialized power tool - a nail gun, circular saw, or drill

Excellent at specific jobs they're designed for
Fast, efficient, reliable for repetitive tasks
Lightweight, portable, easy to use
Affordable for most people

LLMs are like a master craftsman with a full workshop

Can handle complex, custom projects
Adapts to unusual situations and unexpected problems
Expensive to hire, but worth it for intricate work
Brings deep expertise and creative problem-solving

You wouldn't hire a master craftsman to hammer 1,000 identical nails, and you wouldn't use just a nail gun to build custom furniture.
