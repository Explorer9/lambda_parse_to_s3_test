I'm uploading a .txt file containing banking conversations in JSONL format (one JSON array per line). Each array contains conversation turns with context.

Annotate each CUSTOMER turn using the intent definitions from the attached banking_intent_definitions.md file.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. DO NOT write code or use regex - use only your judgment and reasoning
2. Read each conversation naturally as a human would
3. Consider full context to understand customer intent
4. Output as CSV with these columns: conversation_id,turn_id,previous_intent,current_intent,isboundary,dialogueact

CSV FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Include header row
- Boolean values: true or false (lowercase)
- One row per customer turn only (skip agent turns)

ANNOTATION RULES:
- First turn: previous_intent = no_intent
- Subsequent turns: previous_intent = last customer turn's intent
- When current_intent = continuation, previous_intent should be the actual banking intent being continued (not "continuation")
- isboundary = true for new topics, false for continuation
- Dialogue act priority: request > problem_statement > question > provide_information > acknowledgment

Please process the uploaded conversations file and provide the annotated CSV output.
```

## What to upload to Copilot:

1. **banking_intent_definitions.md** - The full guidelines document I provided earlier
2. **conversations.txt** - Your JSONL file renamed to .txt

---

## If Copilot tries to write code:

If Copilot starts generating Python/code, immediately interrupt with:
```
STOP. Do not write code. Read the conversations yourself and annotate them using your judgment. Process each conversation turn by turn, thinking through the intent like a human annotator would.
```

---

## Alternative Approach (if Copilot insists on coding):

Break it into smaller batches:
```
I've uploaded the definitions file and conversations. 

Process the first 5-10 conversations MANUALLY without code:
1. Read each conversation
2. Understand the customer's intent using the definitions
3. Output the CSV rows for those conversations

Do NOT write a script - annotate them yourself using reasoning.
